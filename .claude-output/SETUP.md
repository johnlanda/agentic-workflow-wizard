   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code**
   - Close and reopen Claude Code to load the new configuration
   - The agents and workflows will be automatically recognized

4. **Verify Setup**
   Try a simple command to verify everything is working:
   ```
   "List all available agents"
   ```

## What Was Configured

### Agents Selected
- **orchestrator**: Coordinates all other agents
- **frontend-engineer**: React and TypeScript development
- **backend-engineer**: Node.js and API development
- **database-architect**: PostgreSQL optimization
- **qa-expert**: Testing and quality assurance

### Workflows Created
- **feature-development**: Full feature implementation flow
- **bug-fix**: Rapid bug resolution workflow
- **performance-optimization**: Performance improvement process
- **security-audit**: Security review workflow

### Quality Standards
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- ESLint enforcement
- Performance benchmarks configured

## First Steps

1. **Try a Feature Development**
   ```
   "Implement user authentication with email and password"
   ```
   The orchestrator will automatically coordinate the agents.

2. **Fix a Bug**
   ```
   "Fix the login timeout issue"
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```
   "Run all tests and show coverage"
   ```

## Customization

### Add More Agents
Edit `.claude/project.yaml` and add to the `agents.optional` section:
```yaml
optional:
  - security-reviewer
  - documentation-writer
  - your-custom-agent
```

### Modify Workflows
Edit `.claude/workflows/feature-development.yaml` to adjust the flow.

### Change Quality Standards
Update the `quality_standards` section in `.claude/project.yaml`.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Found
- Ensure all agent files are in `.claude/agents/`
- Check that agent names match exactly

### Workflows Not Triggering
- Verify workflow files are in `.claude/workflows/`
- Check trigger keywords in workflow definitions

### Configuration Not Loading
- Restart Claude Code after changes
- Validate YAML syntax in configuration files
