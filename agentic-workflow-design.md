## 2. Workflow Architecture

### 2.1 Core Architecture Pattern

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Orchestrator Agent              │
│   (Project Manager / Planner)        │
└──────────┬───────────────────────────┘
           │
    ┌──────┴──────┬──────────┬────────────┐
    ▼             ▼          ▼            ▼
┌─────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│Analysis │ │  Design  │ │Develop │ │  Quality │
│ Agents  │ │  Agents  │ │ Agents │ │  Agents  │
└─────────┘ └──────────┘ └────────┘ └──────────┘
```

### 2.2 Agent Hierarchy

**Level 1: Orchestrator**
- **architect-reviewer**: Primary orchestrator for technical decisions and workflow coordination
- Acts as the Contract Net Protocol manager, broadcasting tasks and selecting optimal agents

**Level 2: Phase Specialists**
- **Analysis Phase**: code-reviewer, debugger, error-detective
- **Design Phase**: api-designer, ui-designer, database-administrator
- **Development Phase**: frontend-developer, backend-developer, fullstack-developer
- **Quality Phase**: qa-expert, performance-engineer, accessibility-tester

**Level 3: Task Specialists**
- Language-specific agents (typescript-pro, python-pro, golang-pro)
- Framework-specific agents (react-specialist, django-developer, spring-boot-engineer)
- Tool-specific agents (terraform-engineer, kubernetes-specialist)

## 3. Workflow Patterns

### 3.1 Sequential Orchestration Pattern
**Use Case**: Feature implementation with clear phases

```yaml
workflow:
  name: feature-implementation
  pattern: sequential
  stages:
    - analyze:
        agent: architect-reviewer
        output: requirements.md
    - design:
        agent: api-designer
        input: requirements.md
        output: api-spec.yaml
    - implement:
        agents:
          - frontend-developer
          - backend-developer
        parallel: true
    - test:
        agent: qa-expert
        validation: true
```

### 3.2 Parallel Execution Pattern
**Use Case**: Multi-component development

```yaml
workflow:
  name: fullstack-feature
  pattern: parallel
  components:
    frontend:
      agent: react-specialist
      context: ./frontend
    backend:
      agent: golang-pro
      context: ./backend
    database:
      agent: sql-pro
      context: ./migrations
  synchronization:
    point: integration-test
    agent: qa-expert
```

### 3.3 Hierarchical Task Network Pattern
**Use Case**: Complex project decomposition

```yaml
workflow:
  name: microservices-build
  pattern: hierarchical
  root:
    agent: microservices-architect
    decompose_to:
      - service_design
      - api_contracts
      - deployment_config
  subtasks:
    service_design:
      agents: [backend-developer, database-administrator]
    api_contracts:
      agents: [api-designer, graphql-architect]
    deployment_config:
      agents: [kubernetes-specialist, terraform-engineer]
```

## 10. Best Practices & Guidelines

### 10.1 Agent Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear, focused purpose
2. **Minimal Tool Access**: Grant only necessary tools to reduce security risks
3. **Clear Communication**: Use structured formats for inter-agent messages
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Include fallback strategies and error handling
5. **Document Decisions**: Agents should explain their reasoning

### 10.2 Workflow Optimization

1. **Parallelize When Possible**: Identify independent tasks for concurrent execution
2. **Cache Strategically**: Reuse context and results across agent invocations
3. **Monitor Token Usage**: Track and optimize token consumption patterns
4. **Validate Early**: Include checkpoints to catch issues early
5. **Learn from Execution**: Collect metrics to improve future workflows

### 10.3 Context Management

1. **Compress Aggressively**: Use summaries and key points for older context
2. **Share Selectively**: Pass only relevant context between agents
3. **Persist Important State**: Save critical decisions and outputs
4. **Version Control Configs**: Track agent and workflow changes
5. **Clean Up Regularly**: Remove outdated context and temporary files

## 11. Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Agents not being selected correctly
- Check agent descriptions for clarity
